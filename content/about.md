Software designer. Information engineer. Illustrator.

Based in Gothenburg, Sweden.

Everything I do is informed by the principles of information design: Is it readable? Is it legible? Is it worth reading? From code to illustration, from wiring diagram layouts to UI design.

As Product Owner at Volvo Buses, I transformed how service technicians diagnose electrical systems across electromobility platforms, cybersecurity implementations and active safety systems. I industrialized an extended wiring diagram concept. This reduced fault tracing from an hour to just minutes. The reference materials are now used across 20+ vehicle variants by both aftermarket and R&D teams.

As Scrum Product Owner for three teams delivering diagnostic content and technical documentation, I worked across the entire product lifecycle. This included R&D roadmap ownership, production process industrialization and closing the feedback loop from field diagnostics back to development. I drove agile transformation as coach for our international aftermarket department, championing standardized processes to move teams from uncertainty to clear, actionable planning.

Working with vehicle electronics and communication protocols, I witnessed the automotive industry transforming into a software-defined ecosystem. This inspired me to move from documenting these systems to building them. I enrolled at [Chas Academy](https://chasacademy.se/) to study System Development. Now I work with the whole development chain from embedded device development to backend APIs and web applications.

My experience with vehicle electronics and diagnostics informs my approach to system design. I build solutions that are not just functional, but testable, maintainable and diagnosable from day one.

Graduating in 2026, I bring technical depth, full lifecycle thinking and clear communication to everything I do.
