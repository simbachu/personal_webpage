eevee:
  opinion: "I remember being a little jealous of the rival having Eevee in Yellow, but I really enjoyed having Pikachu myself so I couldn't complain too much. Very cute design of course, it's mascot material front and center."
  rating: A
pichu:
  opinion: "Design wise, I don't really know why they needed this one. But I had a lot of fun playing this in Smash Ultimate, which will save any boring design frankly. It has great costumes there too."
  rating: B
pikachu:
  opinion: "My sister caught a wild Pikachu in Viridian Forest in her version and I didn't get one until I got Yellow. Crazy. Of course its the most iconic Pokémon ever, but it's well deserved."
  rating: A
raichu:
  opinion: "This one has really grown on me. I used to be very content with the Yellow Pikachu not being able to evolve but nowadays I really think that's a major flaw of that game. The regional form is extra good."
  rating: S
surskit:
  opinion: "Peak design and the best name in the franchise, if you're Swedish."

ralts:
  opinion: "Little tripp pants ghost. I really wanted one in Ruby/Sapphire and just walked in the grass in the beginning until I got one. I think I ran out of pokeballs before I got one."
  rating: A
kirlia:
  opinion: "The design is very good but I remember being quite frustrated by the moveset back then. Nowadays I know to use my TMs so that's probably not an issue anymore."
  rating: A
gallade:
  opinion: "Perfection. Good combination of design and playability, I remember having it as basically my main go-to in Diamond."
  rating: S

  rating: D
poliwag:
  opinion: "So cute... I don't want the sins of having a boring 3 step line condemn this little tadpole."
  rating: A
poliwhirl:
  opinion: "It's bigger now, but lost some of the charm from the little tadpole."
  rating: B
poliwrath:
  opinion: "Ok it's boring now. Why are there three of these...?"
  rating: C
politoed:
  opinion: "Did we really need yet another in this line? I didn't even know it was part of this line and I couldn't tell from the design. Awful."
  rating: D
corsola:
  opinion: "Great concept and a Pokémon that I already ranked highly that got a massive boost with the regional form."
  rating: S
togepi:
  opinion: "I used to really not like this one but I spent more time with the rest of the line and now it has grown on me. I just have never liked the eggskell diaper baby design; it feels very Flintstones (neg)."
  rating: B
togetic:
  opinion: "Super cute, I really like the pattern on the ones in this line and think they start really coming into their own here."
  rating: A
togekiss:
  opinion: "Great capstone to the line. I have really enjoyed having this on my team; I think it was in X/Y? Love the pattern and the friendly shape."
  rating: A
victini:
  opinion: "Is this the mascot legendary curse? It is cute and all, but it is also nothing, if you understand."
  rating: C
flareon:
  opinion: "Eeveelutions have a pretty low bar -- kind of hard to mess up. This was always my least favorite of them, but you just can't deny it has charm."
  rating: B
vaporeon:
  opinion: "Maybe the most iconic eeveelution? For good reason too, it has great character and a very funny back profile. The fish tail is very endearing."
  rating: A
jolteon:
  opinion: "Yay spiky butt dog! Very cute. I imagine it would yell 'ZEEEE' at you if you got too close."
  rating: A
umbreon:
  opinion: "The true original goth pokemon. Perfect if you're in the mood for dark and brooding and Shadow the Hedgehog."
  rating: S
espeon:
  opinion: "Espeon's nerd counterpart is just not as good. The shiny color is so good though it gets a bump just from that."
  rating: B
leafeon:
  opinion: "Some people argue the little tufts make this look bad but they are simply wrong. Charlie Brown hair looking ass. Truly a masterpiece."
  rating: A
glaceon:
  opinion: "Bangs like the indie pop girls I used to hang out with. Truly iconic. I don't know a single move this one learns and have no idea about the stat spread but who cares."
  rating: A
noctowl:

  rating: C
joltik:
  opinion: "Very cute spider. Love the colors and the design. Very cute."
  rating: A
galvantula:
  opinion: "Should be hard to miss with a spider but this is not quite on the same level as Joltik."
  rating: B
virizon:
  opinion: "This trio is soooo weird. I think this is the better of them. Why are they musketeers? They're not even from le france."
  rating: B
iron-leaves:
  opinion: "The paradoceses all kind of follow along with how good the base design is. This one is a bit boring though."
  rating: B
cobalion:
  opinion: "Whyyyy do your legs bend like that??? Why are you wearing grippies??? What's with the mustache???"
  rating: C
iron-crown:
  opinion: "Looks better as a robot. I like the spinny."
  rating: B
terrakion:
  opinion: "This one is the worst of the trio. I think this space is kind of crowded in the franchise, and this does little to stand out."
  rating: D
iron-boulder:
  opinion: "Of course, the dumb rock beast becomes a lot more interesting when it's a robot. There's simply more fun stuff with it."
  rating: B
jigglypuff:
  opinion: "Iconic. Fun smash bro. Good mascot. Bowling ball."
  rating: S
scream-tail:

buizel:
  opinion: "Yes I know this is the twink favorite etc. etc. I ahve never been happy to see this one show up in game. Sorry pool toy boys, this goes back into the C."
  rating: C
floatzel:
  opinion: "Bigger Floatzel does not improve on the concept but at least its not Buizel."
  rating: C
slugma:
  opinion: "Who can dislike this little guy? Well, I have ran into it too many times in Rescue Dungeon to be infatuated but I can see the appeal."
  rating: C
magcargo:
  opinion: "I have toreally contort my mouth to pronounce this like escargot like intended. I love snails and slugs but this one doesn't get there sadly."
  rating: D
wo-chien:
  opinion: "Cursed leaf snail with a house of evil writing is a good concept. Some of the artwork make it look really silly though, but the heart is in the right place."
  rating: B
chien-pao:
  opinion: "This one has grown on me quite a bit once I started looing a little closer at it. The mysical quality is good in a legendary, though I think it looks really weird in sprite form."
  rating: B
ting-lu:
  opinion: "Yeah this one is pretty good. I will not beat the bronze artifact designs lover allegations ever for sure."
  rating: B
chi-yu:
  opinion: "Mystical goldfish legendary. That's a good sales pitch! I do like the racing wheel eyes and the striking orange color."
  rating: B
baltoy:
  opinion: It's a neat evocation and a cool type combo but I think over all, it doesn't do enough for me."
  rating: C
claydol:
  opinion: "This one does more than Baltoy but I just can't justify putting this anywhere other than square in the middle."
  rating: C
patrat:
  opinion: "Wasn't this guy targeted by gangs in LA or something? At any rate he's trying to use hypnosis eyes on me which will not work but might work better on you."
  rating: D
watchog:

  rating: A
larvitar:
  opinion: "I don't like this whole line at all, I don't really understand why ground/rock kaiju has an insect lifecycle and you are not fooling me; that is not a larva."
  rating: D
pupitar:
  opinion: "Even in the bug lines, I'm not a big fan of the pupae stages, they're like just a waiting stage for something else, but at least that wait is short. This stupid thing has to be pupa for 25 levels???"
  rating: D
tyranitar:
  opinion: "This works fine as a standalone, and has a pretty cool mega form but it being a whole line... nah. And its always yelling!!"
  rating: C
