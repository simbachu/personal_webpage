eevee:
  opinion: "I remember being a little jealous of the rival having Eevee in Yellow, but I really enjoyed having Pikachu myself so I couldn't complain too much. Very cute design of course, it's mascot material front and center."
  rating: A
pichu:
  opinion: "Design wise, I don't really know why they needed this one. But I had a lot of fun playing this in Smash Ultimate, which will save any boring design frankly. It has great costumes there too."
  rating: B
pikachu:
  opinion: "My sister caught a wild Pikachu in Viridian Forest in her version and I didn't get one until I got Yellow. Crazy. Of course its the most iconic Pokémon ever, but it's well deserved."
  rating: A
raichu:
  opinion: "This one has really grown on me. I used to be very content with the Yellow Pikachu not being able to evolve but nowadays I really think that's a major flaw of that game. The regional form is extra good."
  rating: S
surskit:
  opinion: "Peak design and the best name in the franchise, if you're Swedish."

ralts:
  opinion: "Little tripp pants ghost. I really wanted one in Ruby/Sapphire and just walked in the grass in the beginning until I got one. I think I ran out of pokeballs before I got one."
  rating: A
kirlia:
  opinion: "The design is very good but I remember being quite frustrated by the moveset back then. Nowadays I know to use my TMs so that's probably not an issue anymore."
  rating: A
gallade:
  opinion: "Perfection. Good combination of design and playability, I remember having it as basically my main go-to in Diamond."
  rating: S

poliwag:
  opinion: "So cute... I don't want the sins of having a boring 3 step line condemn this little tadpole."
  rating: A
poliwhirl:
  opinion: "It's bigger now, but lost some of the charm from the little tadpole."
  rating: B
poliwrath:
  opinion: "Ok it's boring now. Why are there three of these...?"
  rating: C
politoed:
  opinion: "Did we really need yet another in this line? I didn't even know it was part of this line and I couldn't tell from the design. Awful."
  rating: D
corsola:
  opinion: "Great concept and a Pokémon that I already ranked highly that got a massive boost with the regional form."
  rating: S
togepi:
  opinion: "I used to really not like this one but I spent more time with the rest of the line and now it has grown on me. I just have never liked the eggskell diaper baby design; it feels very Flintstones (neg)."
  rating: B
togetic:
  opinion: "Super cute, I really like the pattern on the ones in this line and think they start really coming into their own here."
  rating: A
togekiss:
  opinion: "Great capstone to the line. I have really enjoyed having this on my team; I think it was in X/Y? Love the pattern and the friendly shape."
  rating: A
victini:
  opinion: "Is this the mascot legendary curse? It is cute and all, but it is also nothing, if you understand."
  rating: C
flareon:
  opinion: "Eeveelutions have a pretty low bar -- kind of hard to mess up. This was always my least favorite of them, but you just can't deny it has charm."
  rating: B
vaporeon:
  opinion: "Maybe the most iconic eeveelution? For good reason too, it has great character and a very funny back profile. The fish tail is very endearing."
  rating: A
jolteon:
  opinion: "Yay spiky butt dog! Very cute. I imagine it would yell 'ZEEEE' at you if you got too close."
  rating: A
umbreon:
  opinion: "The true original goth pokemon. Perfect if you're in the mood for dark and brooding and Shadow the Hedgehog."
  rating: S
espeon:
  opinion: "Espeon's nerd counterpart is just not as good. The shiny color is so good though it gets a bump just from that."
  rating: B
leafeon:
  opinion: "Some people argue the little tufts make this look bad but they are simply wrong. Charlie Brown hair looking ass. Truly a masterpiece."
  rating: A
glaceon:
  opinion: "Bangs like the indie pop girls I used to hang out with. Truly iconic. I don't know a single move this one learns and have no idea about the stat spread but who cares."

  rating: C
joltik:

  rating: A
galvantula:
  opinion: "Should be hard to miss with a spider but this is not quite on the same level as Joltik."
  rating: B
virizon:
  opinion: "This trio is soooo weird. I think this is the better of them. Why are they musketeers? They're not even from le france."
  rating: B
iron-leaves:
  opinion: "The paradoceses all kind of follow along with how good the base design is. This one is a bit boring though."
  rating: B
cobalion:
  opinion: "Whyyyy do your legs bend like that??? Why are you wearing grippies??? What's with the mustache???"
  rating: C
iron-crown:
  opinion: "Looks better as a robot. I like the spinny."
  rating: B
terrakion:
  opinion: "This one is the worst of the trio. I think this space is kind of crowded in the franchise, and this does little to stand out."
  rating: D
iron-boulder:
  opinion: "Of course, the dumb rock beast becomes a lot more interesting when it's a robot. There's simply more fun stuff with it."
  rating: B
jigglypuff:
  opinion: "Iconic. Fun smash bro. Good mascot. Bowling ball."
  rating: S
scream-tail:
