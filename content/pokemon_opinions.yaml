eevee:
  opinion: "I remember being a little jealous of the rival having Eevee in Yellow, but I really enjoyed having Pikachu myself so I couldn't complain too much. Very cute design of course, it's mascot material front and center."
  rating: A
pichu:
  opinion: "Design wise, I don't really know why they needed this one. But I had a lot of fun playing this in Smash Ultimate, which will save any boring design frankly. It has great costumes there too."
  rating: B
pikachu:
  opinion: "My sister caught a wild Pikachu in Viridian Forest in her version and I didn't get one until I got Yellow. Crazy. Of course its the most iconic Pokémon ever, but it's well deserved."
  rating: A
raichu:
  opinion: "This one has really grown on me. I used to be very content with the Yellow Pikachu not being able to evolve but nowadays I really think that's a major flaw of that game. The regional form is extra good."

ralts:
  opinion: "Little tripp pants ghost. I really wanted one in Ruby/Sapphire and just walked in the grass in the beginning until I got one. I think I ran out of pokeballs before I got one."
  rating: A
kirlia:
  opinion: "The design is very good but I remember being quite frustrated by the moveset back then. Nowadays I know to use my TMs so that's probably not an issue anymore."

poliwag:
  opinion: "So cute... I don't want the sins of having a boring 3 step line condemn this little tadpole."
  rating: A
poliwhirl:
  opinion: "It's bigger now, but lost some of the charm from the little tadpole."
  rating: B
poliwrath:
  opinion: "Ok it's boring now. Why are there three of these...?"
  rating: C
politoed:
  opinion: "Did we really need yet another in this line? I didn't even know it was part of this line and I couldn't tell from the design. Awful."
  rating: D
corsola:

  rating: S
togepi:
  opinion: "I used to really not like this one but I spent more time with the rest of the line and now it has grown on me. I just have never liked the eggskell diaper baby design; it feels very Flintstones (neg)."
  rating: B
togetic:

  rating: A
