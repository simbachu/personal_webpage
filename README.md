## Brief
I wanted to set up a personal homepage using GitHub as source control. I have two versions up on my hosting, a stable version and a development preview.

## Design
Inspired by Jan Tschichold's Neue Typographie, the design is an assymetrical typographic grid layout.
White space is used to create a balance on the page, with blocks of color providing grounding and counterweight to the text elements.

## Technology
- Composer for dependency management
- Twig for templating
- PHPUnit for testing (smoke, unit, and integration tests)
- GitHub Actions for CI/CD
